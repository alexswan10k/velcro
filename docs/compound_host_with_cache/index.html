    <h1>Simple React (with caching)</h1>
    <p>
      This example is similar to the Simple React example with caching, except that instead of the react code living in
      the example's index.js, it will create a sort of union filesystem between Unpkg and a set of in-memory files. The
      in-memory file-system contains the code to render the react components, in the <code>index.js</code>, as well as a
      <code>package.json</code> file that will tell <code>@velcro/runtime</code> how to resolve modules like `react` and
      `react-dom`.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an exercise, try modifying the version ranges for <code>react</code> and <code>react-dom</code> and re-running.
      You will see that the code in the <code>index.js</code> gets versions of its dependencies based on the version
      ranges found in a <code>package.json</code> file; much like you would get if you had run
      <code>npm install</code> and then run the code through a bundler.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, however, there is no bundler. <code>react</code> and <code>react-dom</code>, as well as their dependencies,
      are being loaded fully dynamically.
